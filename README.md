## 📌 Project Overview

This project investigates how artificial intelligence is transforming job markets across industries, roles, and education levels. Through in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), we explore the impacts of automation risk, remote work, required skills, gender diversity, and projected job openings to better understand where opportunities and challenges lie in the evolving world of work.

## 📈 Insights

Some of the key patterns observed include:  

- Higher education levels tend to be associated with roles having lower automation risk  
- Jobs with higher remote work ratios are growing, particularly in knowledge-based industries  
- Gender diversity still shows considerable gaps in some job categories  
- Roles with strong analytical and creative skills are projected to grow  
- Automation risk is most severe for repetitive and routine occupations
